This is the main reason I originally investigated Typed Racket. For instance, if you say " (span ((class "my-code") (decode "exclude")) "foo = foo + bar") " in Python, your intention is to update the value of " (span ((class "my-code") (decode "exclude")) "foo") " to be the sum of " (span ((class "my-code") (decode "exclude")) "bar") " and the current value of " (span ((class "my-code") (decode "exclude")) "foo") ". But even if you don’t care about types, Python still does: before it tries to add these two, it has to check that they both hold numeric values (if they don’t, you’ll get a " (span ((class "my-code") (decode "exclude")) "TypeError") "). Whereas in a typed program, one could declare them both to be " (span ((class "my-code") (decode "exclude")) "Number") "s.

" The question is who does the typing (either you, or the program interpreter) and when (either before the program is running, or during). What we call an “untyped” language is better thought of as an expensively typed language. For many tasks, the convenience of not specifying types outweighs this cost. This is why untyped languages are popular for many jobs. But in some cases, you need the extra performance.") (p "The other benefit of a typed language is " (em "safety") ". Type checking is a way of making and verifying claims about the data and functions in your program in a disciplined manner. In that sense, Typed Racket has a lot in common with Racket’s " (a ((href "http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/contracts.html") (class "ext")) "contract system.") " But because Typed Racket is verifying the types before the program runs, it can catch subtler errors.

Your effort is repaid later when you spend less time chasing down bugs."))

Most Racket libraries are written with untyped code, and Typed Racket—now shortening this to TR—has to use these libraries. TR’s job is to insure that your functions and data are what they say they are. So you can’t just toss untyped code into the mix—“don’t worry TR, this will work.” TR likes you, but it doesn’t trust you.")
