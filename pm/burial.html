<body><h1>I. The Burial of the Dead</h1><p>“You gave me hyacinths first a year ago;<br/>They called me the hyacinth girl.”<br/>—Yet when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden,<br/>Your arms full, and your hair wet, I could not<br/>Speak, and my eyes failed, I was neither<br/>Living nor dead, and I knew nothing,<br/>Looking into the heart of light, the silence.<br/><em>Od’ und leer das Meer.</em></p><p>Madame Sosostris, famous clairvoyante,<br/>Had a bad cold, nevertheless<br/>Is known to be the wisest woman in Europe,<br/>With a wicked pack of cards.</p>
