<body><h1>II. A Game of Chess</h1><p>And still she cried, and still the world pursues,<br/>“Jug Jug” to dirty ears.<br/>And other withered stumps of time<br/>Were told upon the walls; staring forms<br/>Leaned out, leaning, hushing the room enclosed.<br/>Footsteps shuffled on the stair,<br/>Under the firelight, under the brush, her hair<br/>Spread out in fiery points<br/>Glowed into words, then would be savagely still.</p><p>“My nerves are bad to-night. Yes, bad. Stay with me.<br/>Speak to me. Why do you never speak? Speak.<br/>What are you thinking of? What thinking? What?<br/>I never know what you are thinking. Think.”</p>
